# smartmap
An infoware app. (CSS/PHP/JS/MySQL) consisting of a GUI (front-end) and Content Management System (back-end) for the listing of projects, office locations, etc. across a given territory.

As of today, the GUI features the map of the provinces of the Dominican Republic, but can be adapted to map of any country.

This project originally started in 2007 as a freelance job from a client in the Dominican Goverment for the listing of the institution's activities across the country for accountability purposes.
